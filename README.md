Tournament Code tool for Rito Denewb
==============

This basic tool simply reads a form (that has default values that are specific to the target needs) and outputs a Tournament Code for the LoL Client. It inputs a dummy return URL and has no handling for accepting the results as they are not needed for this functionality.

It's nothing more than a very lightweight, basic HTML form and some simply php script, along with a few lines of JS to allow for the "select all" button to function. It's about as quick and dirty as it gets.
