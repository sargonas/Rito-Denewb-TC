Tournament Code tool for Rito Denewb
==============
(NOTE: This tool is no longer practical. The Tournament Code system this leverages has been replaced the Tournament API, and this function is being depreciated from the LoL Client in the near future.)

This basic tool simply reads a form (that has default values that are specific to the target needs) and outputs a Tournament Code for the LoL Client. It inputs a dummy return URL and has no handling for accepting the results as they are not needed for this functionality.

It's nothing more than a very lightweight, basic HTML form and some simply php script, along with a few lines of JS to allow for the "select all" button to function. It's about as quick and dirty as it gets.
